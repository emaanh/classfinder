# **Campus Room Finder ðŸ“š**
A tool to quickly check for available rooms on campus. Find open rooms **right now**, at a specific time, or see full availability for a building/room. 

To gather it's data, this app scrapes a universityâ€™s course registration page, compiling all course schedules, including times and locations, to determine room availability.

## **Features**
âœ… **Find available rooms** right now or at a specific time  
âœ… **View full availability** for any building throughout the day  
âœ… **Fast, robust, lightweight, and easy-to-use CLI**


## **Personal Motivation**
For some reason, I love hanging out in empty classrooms, using the blackboards, studying, talking to friends. Sometimes I want a private place to take a call or do homework between classes.

## **Final Notes**
Sometimes clubs or staff reserve rooms and my program cannot account for that. If a room has an excessive amount of availability during a particular day, that room is more likely to be subject to reservations through your university.

Let me know if you need any changes!
